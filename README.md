# decrypt-pdf-file

This program aimed to decrypt *.pdf file with a password and generate decrypted *.pdf files in a new folder.
You can use the python file (unlock.py) to run it if you have a python environment. If you use Windows system, you can also download the **pdfdecrypted_v1.0.0.exe** file from release and run it.

The use of pdfdecrypted_v1.0.0.exe is easy:
1. create a new folder (e.g. encrypted-files) (No space in the folder name!!!) and put all encrypted files in it
2. open the pdfdecrypted_v1.0.0.exe by double clicking left mouse button
3. input the absolute path of the folder (e.g. D:\encrypted-files)
4. press "Enter" key on your keyboard
5. input the password of pdf files (you MUST assure these files have the same password)
6. press "Enter" key on your keyboard
7. wait for the program finishing its job
8. If the work has finished, the program will notice you to press any key to exit. You can now press any key on your keyboard to exit the program.
9. Now you can find a folder named "decrypted_files" and the decrypted files are in this folder

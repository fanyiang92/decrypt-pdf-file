# decrypt-pdf-file

This program aimed to decrypt *.pdf file with a password and generate decrypted *.pdf files in a new folder.
You can use the python file (unlock.py) to run it if you have a python environment. If you use Windows system, you can also download the **pdfdecrypted_v1.0.0.exe** file from release and run it.

6. press "Enter" key on your keyboard
7. wait for the program finishing its job
8. If the work has finished, the program will notice you to press any key to exit. You can now press any key on your keyboard to exit the program.
